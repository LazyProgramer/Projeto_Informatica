## Secured Roads

### What is Secured Roads

Secured Roads is a bot that will provide users with information of the roads in Aveiro in real time. This is possible thanks to the support of Aveiro Open Lab and machine learning technology.

### How it works

To provide users with the road's state in real-time, Secured Roads utilises the Smart Lamp Post (SLP) created and built by Aveiro Open Lab to check the state of the roads. To do this, it uses the information provided by the radars of the SLP to conclude if there is a traffic jam. 

It can also notify authorities if someone has broken the law or if there has been an accident. It does this by utilising the radars and cameras provided by SLP as well as Twitter posts in conjunction with image recognition.

Thanks to all this, Secured Roads can make the roads of Aveiro just a bit safer.

### How to use

We plan to launch a webapp that will provide users with a live map of the state of the roads of Aveiro.

As well as a bot to provide users with quick messages of the current state of a certain road when asked. This bot will also be available on Twitter.

Sadly, Secured Roads is still in its early stages of development, therefore it still isn't fully operational.

We are expecting to have a working prototype by the end of June.
When said prototype is ready, we will provide the link here.
